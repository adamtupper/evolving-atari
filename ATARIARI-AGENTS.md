# AtariARI Agents: Evolving Agents that use Compact State Representations

One of the initial aims of my work was to evaluate the plausibility of using
NEAT to evolve high-performing agents using compact state representations.

Before, investigating methods for *learning* compact state representations, I used
the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (AtariARI) ([Anand et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08226)) to provide high-quality, low-dimensional state representations for a variety of games.

My preliminary findings for this work were published at [GECCO 2020](https://gecco-2020.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage). An extended version of this paper is available [here](https://github.com/adamtupper/evolving-atari/blob/master/Evolving%20Neural%20Network%20Agents%20to%20Play%20Atari%20Games%20with%20Compact%20State%20Representations%20(Full%20Paper).pdf).
