# AtariARI Agents: Evolving Agents that use Compact State Representations

One of the initial aims of my work was to evaluate the plausibility of using
NEAT to evolve high-performing agents using compact state representations.

Before, investigating methods for *learning* compact state representations, I used
the Atari Annotated RAM Interface (AtariARI) ([Anand et al. 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.08226)) to provide high-quality, low-dimensional state representations for a variety of games.

My preliminary findings for this work were published at [GECCO 2020](https://gecco-2020.sigevo.org/index.html/HomePage). An extended version of this paper is available [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AimVYRvfZPYYgahB8kioVcg1kZBcEg).
