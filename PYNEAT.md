# PyNEAT: A Python Implementation of NEAT

An important component of our work is the use of the NeuroEvolution of
Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm ([Stanley & Miikkulainen 2002](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/106365602320169811)) to evolving policy
networks.

Rather than use an off-the-shelf implementation of NEAT, I developed PyNEAT.
The motivation for this was to allow me the flexibility to modify and extend the
algorithm, and incorporate it as a component within a larger pipeline.

PyNEAT is open source and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/adamtupper/pyneat).
