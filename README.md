# Overview

This website is used to document and publicise ongoing work on my Evolving Atari
project, the purpose of which is to extend research in evolutionary
reinforcement learning.

The current focus of my work is on a hybrid (deep learning + neuroevolution)
learning method for creating general Atari game playing agents, that harnesses
the representational learning power of deep neural networks, and the creativity
and exploration of evolutionary algorithms.

If you're interested in discussing any of my research or related ideas, please
reach out to me.
